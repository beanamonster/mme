## Multiplayer Map Editor

Everyones favorite voxel-based building game by Moosfet.
Here I have uploaded what files I still have for MME as the original website had been taken down. 

### Client

I've decided to include every version possible for the sake of historical entertainment (builds 352 through 640) but you will definitely want to use build 640 for the best experience. 

I want to say there were Linux versions of all of the software here but if it existed, I have no idea where it is now. 

### Server

I will only be including the latest version (that I have) of the server software because they rest of them were just awful. 
If you have any questions about the server, feel free to contact me. It's been a long time, but I'm sure I can still navigate through most of the confusing parts.

### Source

The source code will not be provided publicly, but I might consider sharing it upon request. 
If you are fluent in C programming and are interested in advancing the state of MME, please let me know.
